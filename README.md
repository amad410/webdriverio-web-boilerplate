# Introduction 
This sample is designed for use in VsCode and includes source code for testing the web frontend using WebDriverIO Mocha with TypeScript. It also uses the Allure reporter to report results 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1. Install node
2. Install npm
3. Install VsCode

Here is the most basic folder structure of a WebDriverIO project:
 - .vscode: This folder contains the Visual Studio Code configuration file that specifies debugging settings
 - reports: This folder contains the HTML and JSON reports generated by the test runner.
 - screenshots: This folder contains screenshots captured during test execution.
 - tests: This folder contains all the test files, along with any associated data, helpers, and page objects.
 - specs: This folder contains the actual test files written in Mocha/Chai syntax.
 - data: This folder contains any test data in JSON format that is used in the test files.
 - helpers: This folder contains helper functions used in the test files.
 - pageobjects: This folder contains the Page Object Model (POM) files that define the web page elements and actions.
 - config: This folder contains the WebdriverIO configuration file (wdio.conf.js) and any environment variables required for test execution.
 - package.json: This file specifies the project's dependencies and metadata, including the test runner (mocha), assertion library (chai), and WebdriverIO packages (@wdio/cli, @wdio/local-runner, etc.)

# Install Dependencies
On the commandline at the base of the project, perform 
_npm install_

# Verify Installation
From command line navigate to source project folder and perform
Run _npm run wdio_
NOTE: Make sure your browser is up-to-date.

# Check version of Cypress
To check your version of Cypress you can perform the following:
_npx wdio --version_ 

# Migration
You can migrate to a new version of WebDriverIO when one becomes available. Consult Migration section in docs [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted)

# Updating Individual Packages
If you want to an individual package you need to perform the following:
_npm install <packagename>@latest_
Example:
_npm install chromedriver@latest_
_npm install @wdio/cli@latest_

# Updating All Packages
Install the package update checker using this documentation [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates)

Run the following command to determine the difference between all package versions in package.json versus the latest out there:
_npx ncu_

Then to update all packages that have been identified, you can run the following to update your package.json:
_npx npm-check-updates -u_ 

Then run _npm install_ to install new versions from your package.json.

# Build and Test
1. From command line navigate to source project folder and perform 
## Run all tests interactively
_npm run wdio_

NOTE: By default, the tests will run in headless mode.  If you want to run interactively, comment out chromeoptions section in config file as outlined [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/configurationfile/)

## Run specific spec interactively
_npm run wdio --spec example.e2e.js_

NOTE: By default, the tests will run in headless mode.  If you want to run interactively, comment out chromeoptions section in config file as outlined [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/configurationfile/)

## Run specific spec noninteractively
By default, tests run in headless mode. 

## Run all tests using CLI
_npm run wdio_

NOTE: By default, the tests will run in headless mode.  If you want to run interactively, comment out chromeoptions section in config file as outlined [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/configurationfile/)

## Run specific suite interactively
See documentation [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/organizingsuites/)
_npm run wdio --suite <suiteName>_

NOTE: By default, the tests will run in headless mode.  If you want to run interactively, comment out chromeoptions section in config file as outlined [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/configurationfile/)

## Wait Strategies
 1. Waits - [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/autowait/)
 2. WaitForClickable - [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/element/waitForClickable/)
 3. WaitForDisplayed - [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/element/waitForDisplayed)
 4. WaitForEnabled - [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/element/waitForEnabled)
 5. WaitForExist - [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/element/waitForExist)
 6. WaitUntil - [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/element/waitUntil)


## Run tests using CLI for a specific browser
Consult the Services section [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted)
 | [Standalone service](https://webdriver.io/docs/selenium-standalone-service)

By default, this framework is wired to support the following browser tests:
 - Chrome
 - Firefox
 - Edge

 NOTE: By default, the tests will run in headless mode.  If you want to run interactively, comment out chromeoptions section in config file as outlined [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/configurationfile/)

## Run tests using CLI using a different environment
Cross ENV is the package library that is being used to run test across multiple environments [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env). By default the following JSON environment configurations are included:
1. LOCAL
2. DEV
3. QA
4. STAGE

You can point to a specific baseUrl based on the configurations you pass above. For example, the following will run agains the QA environment specified in the wdio.conf.ts file:
_npx cross-env ENV=QA npm run test_

NOTE: By default, the tests will run in headless mode.  If you want to run interactively, comment out chromeoptions section in config file as outlined [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/configurationfile/)

# Configurations
See documentation [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/watcher/#:~:text=With%20the%20WDIO%20testrunner%20you,it%20ran%20all%20tests%2C%20e.g.)

# Reports
The most popular types are:
1. [Spec](https://webdriver.io/docs/spec-reporter/)
2. [Allure](https://webdriver.io/docs/allure-reporter)
3. [Mochawesome](https://webdriver.io/docs/wdio-mochawesome-reporter)

## Generate Report
By default, this framework is set to use _spec_ and _allure_. To generate the allure report:

_npm run report_
